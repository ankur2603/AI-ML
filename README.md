# AIML Projects

This repository contains my projects and practice work in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** using **Python**.  
The projects focus on learning the fundamentals of AI/ML, data handling, and implementing algorithms using popular Python libraries.

## Structure

- `Data_Cleaning/` – Projects related to data preprocessing and cleaning using **Pandas**.
- `ML_Algorithms/` – Implementations of machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, KMeans, etc.
- `Mini_Projects/` – Small AI/ML projects to practice concepts.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## About Me

I am a first-year undergraduate engineering student passionate about AI, ML, and Python programming.  
Through these projects, I aim to strengthen my understanding of AI/ML concepts while building practical, hands-on experience.
